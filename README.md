# 👋 Hi, I'm @phantom-bytes 

🧠 I'm fascinated by the intersection of AI/ML and cybersecurity.  

🌱 I'm currently diving deeper into:
  * Adversarial Machine Learning 
  * Building secure AI infrastructure 
  * Reverse engineering malware (for research purposes, of course 😉)

🤝 I'm looking to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of AI security.  Think novel detection methods, robust AI systems, and exploring the ethics of AI in security.

📫 How to reach me: You can find me on [link to relevant platform, maybe Twitter or a security-focused forum].  Let's connect and discuss all things AI and security!

⚡ Fun fact: I once built an AI that could write poetry... about buffer overflows.
